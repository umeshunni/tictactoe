## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**‚ùå "Connection failed"**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure the server supports WebSockets
- Try a different deployment platform

**‚ùå "Room not found"**
- Room codes expire after 30 minutes
- Create a new game if codes are old

**‚ùå Local development not working**
- Run `npm install` first
- Check that port 3000 is available
- Use `http://localhost:3000`

### Platform-Specific Notes:

- **Railway**: Automatic HTTPS, best WebSocket support
- **Heroku**: Reliable, but may sleep after 30min inactivity (free tier)
- **Vercel**: Great for static files, limited WebSocket support
- **Render**: Good free tier, reliable WebSocket support

## Scaling Your Game

Once deployed, your game can handle:
- **Multiple concurrent games** (hundreds of rooms)
- **Real-time gameplay** with low latency
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired rooms

For high traffic, consider upgrading to paid tiers or using Redis for session storage.
